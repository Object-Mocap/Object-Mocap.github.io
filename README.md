## What/Why?
Outlined below is a process for creating a collaboratively built “collage” motion capture figure, which may then be used in educational settings as a tool for language learning for early childhood learners (K-5). The collage figure is an armature made up of pre-existing or custom-built 3D assets which correlate to the quality of movement. The group of learners is able to decide what objects the armature should be made of, in relation to its movement. Through this process, they practice embodiment of the perceived movement within their own bodies, and then use advanced vocabulary to describe and make associations.

## Process

The motion capture (.bvh) data can come from one of several sources: Pre-recorded motion captures done with a set-up such as the OptiTrack system; AI generated motion; Live motion captures; etc. 

The data is input into a website (currently in development) where it can be played out on an armature that is primed for collaborative building (collaging). By this we mean that the armature is a blank template for objects to replace its bone structures, e.g. a traffic cone for a leg.
